    Shaun: Brah, I was just down there.
    Avery: Yeah, but now we'll be down there with beers, telling scary stories.

    Avery: I heard Tracy scream. What's going on?
    Luigi: What the hell, Shaun, you know how easily she gets startled!
    Avery: Wait, that's all it took? Boo?
    Luigi: This isn't funny, Avery.
    Shaun: I have no idea why I did that, honest!
    Avery: Yeah, yeah. Look, dude, how about we go down to the lake. Tell some scary stories.
    Shaun: Are you sure?
    Avery: Of course! There's no way you'll be able to scare me.
